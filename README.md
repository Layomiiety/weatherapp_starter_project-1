Stargazing-Weather-App-Hi-fi
Develop the hi-fi interactive prototype of the weather app you designed in Task 2. For simplicity of implementation, you will code, run and test your weather app on desktop/laptop. Use mouse input to emulate touch input. Build the interface using Java and/or its variants (e.g., Java FX, Android Java, Flutter, or similar) as and where appropriate (whether you choose to use a GUI Designer/Scene Builder or not is up to you. The focus here is on the functionality, usability and aesthetics of the user interface – do not spend time developing back end programs such as database systems. According to the needs of your target user group, choose an appropriate free weather provider API to develop your weather app.

In Task 3, we are interested in seeing both the demonstration of your programming skills and how well your implementation fits the design and the requirements you identified in Task 1. Important aspects you should address: Interactivity - how well the system interacts (fast and smooth transition between screens); Clarity - how clear your hi-fi design is Aesthetics - appropriate and pleasing use visual design features (e.g. background/foreground, colours, fonts, icons, and grouping of information) Structuring your code - good Model-View structure Supporting multiple screen ratios - using more sophisticated layout than absolute positioning Advanced interaction and programming - e.g. developing your own widgets vs. inheriting from AWT/Swing; building UI from scratch without a GUI Designer/Scene Builder Advanced graphic design - e.g. professional quality graphics elements, layout, and animations

Consider the following: Your hi-fi prototype should be interactive, intuitive and self-explanatory – i.e., a user should not need a manual to be able to use it Your code should be legible to externals – i.e., you should comment your code thoroughly Your code must acknowledge any elements re-used from your previous work(s) or any external code used Your code should run without you being present – i.e., you should provide a Readme file that explains how to run your weather app, what libraries you have used, and if it runs on any Windows / Mac / Linux computer etc.

Besides implementing the hi-fi prototype, also prepare a brief document covering the following: Conduct one form of usability evaluation on your prototype (e.g. usability testing, heuristic evaluation, cognitive walkthrough). Describe which method you used, what you learnt from the evaluation, and any details you changed in the design as a result of the evaluation (500 words max) Did you need to deviate from your lo-fi design in any other way? If so, why? (150 words max)

SUBMISSION: Submit your code and supporting files electronically as a SINGLE zipped folder title Task3_GroupXY.zip for the whole group via the Moodle module page, which contains the following:

All source code files, and any IDE files needed to compile and run your code A executable file (e.g. jar file), if that makes running your prototype easier Readme_GroupXY.txt which explains how to run your code and what libraries are used Changes_GroupXY.pdf which explains your usability evaluation and any deviations from your design with rationale for the changes

Deadline: 23 May noon - 12pm
